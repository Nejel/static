In this challenge, we practice calculating the probability of a compound event. We recommend you review today's Probability Tutorial before attempting this challenge.

Task
There are 2 urns labeled X, Y, and Z.

Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.
Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
Urn Z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls.

One ball is drawn from each of the  urns. What is the probability that, of the  balls drawn,  are red and  is black?

P1=P(X1)=
=p1⋅q2⋅q3+q1⋅p2⋅q3+q1⋅q2⋅p3.
p1, p2, p3 -- probability of red ball in urns 1,2,3.
q1, q2, q3 -- probability of black ball in urns 1,2,3.

Answer: 0.46
